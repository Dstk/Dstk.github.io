<h1>Devon's About Me Page</h1>
<h2>My name is Devon Stark. <br>I have lived in Washington for over 20 years, so i'm basically a native, and have been working at Adobe in Fremont for two years.</h2>
<p> I began work at Adobe back in 2015, shortly before the summer intern expo. I had recently left a job as a 911 operator in Kent and was looking to move into Seattle, so I needed a job in the city. I enjoy working for Adobe, the company culture is pretty relaxed and they definitely focus on employee satisfaction. Part of the reason I am in this class today is to advance their "Adobe Digital Academy" program.
<p> Taking coding classes and assisting with program development isn't the only thing that I do at Adobe however. My other job duties consist of
<ol class="details">
<li>New employee and intern onboarding</li>
<li>Internal and external event planning</li>
<li>Multi-site accounting</li>
<li>Building project oversight</li>
</ol>
<p id="ending">I would love to take more coding classes while I assist adobe in furthering their corporate responsibility</p>
